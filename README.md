In this project we mainly got familiar with random process and quantization in communication systems.
We use Matlab functions and enhancements to describe our demands and compare the programming results with our theorem calculations.
Mostly we faced with these 3 topics:
  1.	Rayleigh Random Process
  2.	Random Process and its Properties
  3.	Introduction to Digital Communications

In each phase, we faced with some random variables and processes.
In addition, we got familiar with some basic concepts of some specific processes. Like stationary process and its properties, signal modulations with gaussian noise, autocorrelation and average of a random process and Quantization method.
Specifically, in quantization process, we indicate the impact of sample rates in conversion of a continues signal into a district signal and the way that quantization levels affect in the quantized signal.
Finally, I can say that this project helped us to face with the real uses of Statistics and Probability and their formulas in signal processing and quantization modulation.
